This repository contains 5 programs, one being the main, and 4 sets of csv data.
All of the files should be stored in the same directory.

For the dataframe inputs code you should use the data with "England" in the title, or any csv data in the same format of two columns and in data time.
All programs that are not in the main will be run in the main and you will be asked whether you will want to run them.

For the SIRD model, the variable values we recommend should be along the lines of the following:

Initially infected people : 1

Recovered : 0

Dead : 0

Contact rate : 1.2

Recovery rate : 0.1

Death rate : 0.05

Time : 100

Sometimes after pulling the git and running main_simulation.py it might say modules reloaded and you may have to enter your options again.

In addition all of the imported modules can be run by themselves and do not require the main to run.
